title: The origin of bug, loop and patch
---

Library, bug, patch, loop - these words have been part of programmer lingo for decades, and on my recent trip to the US east coast I stumbled accross their orgin: 

[The Harvard Mark I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I):

This amazing machine was one of the first programmable computers, but I'll tell you more about this beauty at the end of the post.

## The Loop

The "program" is a long paper tape with holes punched in that runs in this loop. Conditional branching is not supported (no gotos, jumps); you just have one long "while (true)".

## The Patch

A correction is made by literally patching a piece of the tape and punching new holes in. Fix your code with duct tape!

## The Bug

The classic! This "bug" was found on a Mark II mechanical component, so was not really a program error. It must have been "working on my machine".

As promised, here are more tidbits I found interesting:

* It was Steampunk! Ok, I mean it was electro-mechanical. The invetor Howard H. Aiken basically built a Babbage engine on steriods. 
* John Von Neumann used it to help design the atom bomb. Seems most of our high-tech was born in that war.
* The number system was decimal, not binary. So you could use all your fingers to code.
* It ran solidly for 15 years. Seems Moore's didn't apply to mechanical computers.
* The inventor did not give attribution IBM, who funded and helped to build it. I guess they had employed lots of laywers after that.
