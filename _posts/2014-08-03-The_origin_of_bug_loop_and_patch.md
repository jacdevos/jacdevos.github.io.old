title: The origin of bug, loop and patch
---

Bug, loop and patch - these words have been part of programmer lingo for decades, and on my recent trip to the US east coast I stumbled accross their orgin: 

The [Harvard Mark I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I) aka Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator!

This amazing machine was one of the first programmable computers. I'll tell you more about this beauty at the end of the post.

## "Loop"

![The Harvard Mark I Loop]({{ site.url }}/public/marki_loop.JPG)

The actual mechanical loop. The *program* is a long paper tape with holes punched in and runs in this loop. Conditional branching is not supported (no gotos, jumps); you just have one long *while (true)*.

## "Patch"

An actual patch. A correction is made by literally patching a piece of the tape and punching new holes in. Fix your code with duct tape!

## "Bug"

The classic! This "bug" was found on a Mark II mechanical component, so not really a program error. It must have been *working on my machine*.

## More..
Tidbits I found interesting:

* Its started computing 70 years ago!
* It was Steampunk! Ok, I mean it was electro-mechanical. The inventor Howard Aiken basically built a Babbage engine on steriods.
* John Von Neumann used it to help design the atomic bomb. Seems most of our high-tech was born in that war.
* The number system was decimal, not binary. So you could use all your fingers to count.
* It ran solidly for 15 years. Seems Moore's Law didn't apply to mechanical computers.
* The inventor did not give attribution IBM, who funded and helped to build it. I guess after this they started employing lots of laywers.

Parts of the machine is on display at the Harvard University Science Center (where I took these photos). Hope you enjoyed this discovery as much as I did.
