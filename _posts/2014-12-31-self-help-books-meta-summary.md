As a software engineering coach part of my job is to help teams become more effective. To this end, it is sometimes useful to employ concepts from self-help books, but I don’t always enjoy reading these, they often stretch a few insights into endless anecdotes.

The [Blinkist](http://www.blinkist.com) app really helped me with this dilemma last week; I managed to cover the key insights of 40+ books in just a few days.  Good job [Blinkist](http://www.blinkist.com).

During this self-help binge, I noticed a few ideas being repeated in a wide variety of books, especially the more core principles.

Here are a few insights that struck me as reoccurring, as well as the books they came from:

### On being effective:
*	The best way to be more effective is to focus only on highest impact things next. *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (First things first), The 80/20 Principle, The 4-Hour Workweek and others.*
*	Be more productive by doing only one thing at a time. *The Pomodoro Technique, Getting Things Done, The Principles of Product Development Flow and others.*
*	Define a simple system of prioritised queues with small work items to visualise and manage work. *Getting things Done, The Principles of Product Development Flow, The Pomodoro technique.*
*	Have goals: define explicit goals and values and measure your progress against them. *Most of the productivity books I read have this idea in some form; I liked what Challenging Coaching said on it.*

### On becoming a better thinker / communicator:
*	People inherently don’t make rational decisions/predictions – be aware of your innate cognitive flaws. E.g. we are intuitively bad at stats. *Thinking, Fast and Slow, The Black Swan, Predictably Irrational.*
*	Practice can make hard things automatic and frees your mind up to innovate. *Thinking, Fast and Slow, Outliers, Mastery.*
*	A story with a protagonist and an antagonist is the best format for conveying information in presentations, specifications, etc. *The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, User Story Mapping.*
*	Surround yourself with people you can learn from. *Mastery and many others.*

### On adapting and learning:
*	Managing well entails putting frequent, lightweight, honest feedback mechanisms in place at various levels. *The One Minute Manager, The Lean Startup, The Principles of Product Development Flow, Challenging Coaching and others.*
*	Build small versions of your product first and get feedback from early niche, adopters. *The Lean Startup, Crossing the Chasm*
*	Become good at adapting to change quickly, or die. *The Innovator’s Dilemma, Who Moved My Cheese*

### On finding opportunities
*	Build and contribute to your professional network; it’s a more secure structure than a company. *The Tipping Point, Coffee, Lunch, Coffee, Never eat alone*
*	The Internet and social media have opened up marketing for a bigger variety of products. *The Long Tail, Purple Cow*
