### Building valuable software is a multifaceted hydra; my professional goal is to slay it.

With more than a decade experience in leading development teams on cutting-edge software systems, I'm focused on building products, teams and processes that not only meet immediate business needs, but enable strategic goals.

Most of my experience so far has been in developing enterprise applications, specifically in the financial industries (online trading, online banking, insurance call-centre, branch banking).

Lately my focus has moved to coaching software engineering teams and businesses of all shapes and sizes on how to excel at building the right stuff, well. This touches on a wide variety of areas like team culture, processes, engineering practices and software architecture approach. I must have learnt at least as much as the people I coached!

I also actively develop mobile-focussed software products, incorporating all platforms.
