<strong>Building valuable software is a multifaceted hydra; my professional goal is to slay it.</strong>
<br/><br/>
With more than a decade experience in leading development teams on cutting-edge software systems, I'm focused on building products, teams and processes that not only meet immediate business needs, but enable strategic goals.
<br/><br/>
Most of my experience so far has been in developing enterprise applications, specifically in the financial industries (online trading, online banking, insurance call-centre, branch banking).
<br/><br/>
Lately my focus has moved to coaching software engineering teams and businesses of all shapes and sizes on how to excel at building the right stuff, well. This touches on a wide variety of areas like team culture, processes, engineering practices and software architecture approach. I must have learnt at least as much as the people I coached!
<br/><br/>
I also actively develop mobile-focussed software products, incorporating all platforms.
